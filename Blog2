Todays blog I will be talking about encryption. Encryption means: concealing information to render it unreadable. 
Encryption can provide your data with :
1. Confidentiality 
2. Integrity 
3. Non-repudiation 
4. Data that bears no signature
The non-repudiation is important because this guarantees that if the sender cannot deny that they sent the message in court. 

There are different types of ciphers that are used when a message is sent:
1. Caesar Cipher
2. Substitute Cipher
The caesar cipher was the very first cipher. Substitution Cipher is very basic encryption, substitutes plaintext with corresponding cipher text. This means for example, I can send a message out and 
substitute each letter by using a letter and the actual letter would be 4 letters down, this way if the message is intercepted, it is just a bunch of letter jumbled up but when it gets to the destination, the users either private or public key allows the receiver to read the message. 
The best type of security  is called Symmetric Cryptography. Symmetric Cryptography has excellent performance and it is very hard to decrypt without a key.  Another type of cryptography is Asymmetric Cryptography, each side has a public key and only the holder knows their own private key. Everyone can know the users public key. What the public key encrypts the private key decrypts. What the private key encrypts, the public key decrypts. The one downfall to Asymmetric Cryptography, it is very slow.
