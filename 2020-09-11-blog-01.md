Todays blog I will be discussing HTML in order to create a website. I have learned so far the basics in regards to tags, attributes, syntax, best practices for writing and editing an HTML page. 
HTML is a very important part of creating a website for either personal or business use. 
When creating a website, there are three important languages that work together to make a functioning and organized website:
1. HTML- Provides the essential structure for web pages.
2. CSS- Controls how a page looks. 
3. JavaScript- Controls how it behaves. 
So far I have learned the first part which is HTML. HTML stands for “Hypertext Markup Language “. Hypertext Markup Language is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets and scripting languages such as JavaScript. Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. What this means is that HTML is used to mark up content in order to explain what that content is and how it relates to other content on the page, this is done through the use of tags, which are used to identify specific types of content. 
Here are some HTML tags and what they identify:
1. <p> tag= identifies the content as a paragraph
2. <n> tag= identifies its content as being part of the page’s navigation.
Since HTML is a mark up language this means we need tags to mark up content on the page to identify it. In order to create paragraphs we need <p> and at the end of the paragraph when finished, we close it out with a </p>.  When creating a paragraph, just a <p> is usually not enough, especially if you feel that some of the users of the website may be sing readers, this is where attributes come to play. Specific attributes are needed but the paragraph tag does not have specific attributes, but it has global attributes, this is why attributes are needed to specify for the specific tag.  A reader will read in its default language if you create a paragraph with the syntax as follows: <p>Hello World</p>, but if you want the reader to know what language it needs to read it in this is the proper syntax: <p lang=“en”>Hello World</p>, here you have told it that the language that it should be read in is English. 
There are two types of attributes: there is informative and functional. The informative gives extra information  about the element and the functional is used for instances such as links. For links there is an attribute which is href. The href attribute tells the browser where to go when the link is clicked. There are attributes that that are really important and functional whereas there are other attributes that just give the  browser a little bit of information. 
When creating a webpage you need to structure it properly you need to have a doctype declaration and it needs to reflect the version of HTML will be used, ie: the latest HTML5. Within the html tag there are two main regions:
1. <head> = 
    * meta tag that describes the utf-8 encoding that should be used and describes tags that help with search engines placement. Title is needed in every page for accessibility. 
2. <body> =
    * Within the body tag, you’re going to have the visual elements of the page
        * Header
        * Paragraph 
        * Sidebars 
        * Footers 
        * Etc
In webapages there are certain content that fit within specific sections, this is where structure content come to play. 
Here are a few sectioning elements:
        * <h1> … <h6>
        * <article>
        * <aside>
        * <nav>
        * <section>
For users, the actual structure of the page has to convey the information about the content. If the page isn’t structured properly, the page content will have no heiherchy and no way to convey how the content relates to each other, this is where HTML’s sectioning and heading elements come in. 
These are Semantic Elements:
        * <header>
        * <main>
        * <footer>
Semantic Elements help add structure and meaning to your document as well. 
Listing is the last topic that I have learned. There are different types of listing which can be used for listing dates or categories. 
There two types of list:
        1. <ul> = Unordered List
        2. <ol> = Ordered List
<ul></ul> is used for Unordered List which gives you bullet points and then there is <ol></ol>, this one is an ordered list which will put it in a numbered list. Wether you are using <ul> or <ol>, in between you need <li> which puts in order the list. You can also combine the two when you have a list with numbers but for each numbered item, there is bullet points to add to the list, in this case you would do it as follows:
<ol>
	<li>Item One </li>
	   <ul>Item 3.1 </li>
 </ol>
This will give you Item One as 1. Item One and Item 3.1 follows with a bullet point on the webpage. 

This is so far the basics that I have learned in HTML and that is barely scratching the surface, there is still a lot that I need to learn in order to create an attractive and well organized webpage. I can’t wait to learn the remainder of HTML, CSS and JavaScript so I can create a page that will attract users.
