Welcome to Senior Design 2, this is finally my last semester prior to graduating, it has been a long road but I am finally here and I do hope this semester. This semester I will blogging about the last class that is needed for me to graduate. The subject that I will be discussing in my blogs will be is Database Management. In this class I will be learning about the ERD, which includes: attributes, the business rules when talking about 1-to1, 1-to-Many, and Many-to-Many. I will learn how entities work and how they relate to their attributes. 
Here are some definitions that I have learned so far:
Database- organized collect logically related data
Data- Stored representations of meaningful objects and events; structured: numbers, text, dates: Unstructured; images, video, documents
Information- data processed to increase knowledge in the person using the data
Metadata- Data that describes the properties and context of user data ( data about data)
The definitions that I just discussed are an example of what I will be learning this semster, in addition I will be getting the opportunity to work with SQL. This should be a very interesting semester and I look forward to sharing the knowledge I gain from this course.
